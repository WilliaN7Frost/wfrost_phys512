Code functionality:

  - 'particles.py' contains the classes for 2D and 3D particles.
     It contains all the necessary functions to run the simulation.
     
  - 'run_nobody2D.py' uses the 'particles2d' class from 'particles.py
    to output plots of a 2D n-body simulation.
  
  - 'run_nobody3D.py' uses the 'particles3d' class from 'particles.py
    to output plots of a 3D n-body simulation.


Additional comments:

  - Due to the enormous runtime I encountered when simulating in 3D, coupled 
    with unsatisfactory plotting of the results,  most of my videos produced are in 2D.
